Dandelion is a wrapper for the amazing Git Split Tree utility [https://github.com/splitsh/lite](splitch-lite). splitch-lite allows you to split a monolithic repository into multiple read-only repositories. Dandelion allows you to use splitch-lite through a phar file and adds a neat configuration management on top of it.
